# Top 3 Insights from Analysis of Employee Data
Edit: This is one of my first attempts on exploratory data analysis and data visualisation in Python; there will be more exciting repositories in future! For instance, my friend and I participated in the LifeHack 2020 Datathon, where we created some exciting choropleth maps; the repository can be found [here](https://github.com/leongjwm/Covid-19-Modelling).

In this project, I will analyse a dataset of the employees in an insurance company. My goal of analysing this dataset is to find the top 3 insights which might benefit the company as a whole.
