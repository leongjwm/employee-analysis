# Top 3 Insights from Analysis of Human Capital Data
In this project, I will pretend to be a data analyst in an insurance company; the dataset I will be using is a dummy file which contains the details of all employees in the company. My goal of analysing this dataset is to find the top 3 insights which might benefit the company as a whole.

This is done using Jupyter Notebook.
